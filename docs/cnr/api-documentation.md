# API Documentation

CentralNic Reseller provides his products and services through a Backend System that is accessible by different options. One of these options is a HTTP API for which we provide a [SDK]({{ 'docs/cnr/sdks' | relative_url }}) just in PHP, more to come (nodejs, go, ...). You may use this connector library to connect your systems/frontends to the HEXONET Backend System.

Find our Backend System API well documented [here](//www.centralnicreseller.com/api) (see HTTPS socket) and the command reference [here](//kb.centralnicreseller.com/api/api-commands/api-command-reference).

Whenever you need to know details about an API Command and its API Response, have a read there.
