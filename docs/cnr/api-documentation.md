# API Documentation

RRPproxy provides his products and services through a Backend System that is accessible by different options. One of these options is a HTTP API for which we provide a [SDK]({{ 'docs/rrpproxy/sdks' | relative_url }}) just in PHP, more to come (nodejs, go, ...). You may use this connector library to connect your systems/frontends to the HEXONET Backend System.

Find our Backend System API well documented [here](//www.rrpproxy.net/API) (see HTTPS socket) and the command reference [here](//wiki.rrpproxy.net/api/api-commands/api-command-reference).

Whenever you need to know details about an API Command and its API Response, have a read there.
