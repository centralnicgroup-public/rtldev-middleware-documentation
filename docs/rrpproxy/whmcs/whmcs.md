# WHMCS

>>>>> **Web Hosting Automation Made Easy**

WHMCS (Web Host Manager Complete Solution) is an all-in-one domain provisioning, client management, billing/invoicing, and client support solution for any business selling through a website. WHMCS has become the World Leader in this market. By coupling WHMCS with one of CentralNic Brand's Registrar Module - namely HEXONET, RRPproxy, internet.bs and TPP WholeSale, anyone can start reselling hundreds of profitable domain name extensions (TLDs) quickly and in ease.

WHMCS allows to send high quality professional looking invoices to customers with its billing functionality. This functionality is no obstacle when it comes to deal with different currencies and tax support. It combines a lot other great features such as automated reminders for unpaid invoices, setting up late fees rules, supporting several payment gateways and many more.

WHMCS can be accessed using two APIs - an [Internal API](https://developers.whmcs.com/api/internal-api/) and an [External API](https://developers.whmcs.com/api/getting-started/). Thus, it allows users flexible ways to perform all necessary Operations. Regarding Domain Registrars, WHMCS comes with a regularly triggered [Domain Synchronization Process](https://docs.whmcs.com/Domain_Synchronisation) that cares about keeping the Status and the Expiry Date of a Domain in Sync with the underlying Registrar's System by invoking the Registrar's Module Integration for this Process. 50 Domains are covered per run and only Domains in Status `Pending Transfer` and `Active` are considered.

If you have not yet WHMCS set up, please follow their [Installation Guide](https://docs.whmcs.com/Installing_WHMCS) which explains the Installation Process completely and well. System Requirements can be found [here](https://docs.whmcs.com/System_Requirements) - there you'll also find notes about the support of specific platforms like Windows. You should be aware of all that.
