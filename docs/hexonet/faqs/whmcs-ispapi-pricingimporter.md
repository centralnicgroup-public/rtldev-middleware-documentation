### 1. Which commands to whitelist when using a restrictive user role

Find all such commands listed [here]({{ 'docs/hexonet/whmcs/whmcs-ispapi-registrar/#create-a-role-user' | relative_url }}) per module.

### 2. Not importing all TLDs

Please have a look [here]({{ 'docs/hexonet/whmcs/whmcs-ispapi-pricingimporter/#setting-max_input_vars' | relative_url }}).
The value of PHP Setting `max_input_vars` is configured too low.
