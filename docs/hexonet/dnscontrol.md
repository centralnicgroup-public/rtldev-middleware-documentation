# DNSControl

[![License: MIT]({{ 'assets/images/License-MIT-blue.svg' | relative_url }})](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StackExchange/dnscontrol/master/LICENSE)

A Domain-specific Language (DSL) for DNS as Code from StackOverflow.com.

## Introduction

DNSControl is an opinionated platform for seamlessly managing your DNS configuration across any number of DNS hosts, both in the cloud or in your own infrastructure. It manages all of the domains for the Stack Overflow network, and can do the same for you!

Find a introductory Video at Youtube.com [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Bx2FGyeRsY). It explains why the StackExchange Team wrote DNSControl and why DNSControl is of interest for you, too. Worth it!

Find their full documentation available [here](https://docs.dnscontrol.org).

## Our Provider Plugin

Our Provider is shipped with DNSControl - no extra download.
Still, getting started comes with knowing about how. DNSControl has its own configuration file Syntax that is following the JavaScript principles and is therefore easy to learn.

Find [here](https://docs.dnscontrol.org/service-providers/providers/hexonet) the documentation of our Provider Plugin.

Find [here](https://github.com/hexonet/dnscontrol-dnsconfig) a basic setup and example for the HEXONET Integration.
