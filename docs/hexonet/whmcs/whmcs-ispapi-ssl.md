# ISPAPI SSL Certs

[![License: MIT]({{ 'assets/images/License-MIT-blue.svg' | relative_url }})](//opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

This Repository covers the WHMCS SSL Module of HEXONET. It provides the following features in WHMCS:

## Introduction

The ISPAPI SSL Module is a combination of an addon and a provisioning module.

The SSL addon provides a user friendly interface to automatically import SSL certificates as WHMCS products. In addition, it gives the possibility to update prices based on current cost and configurable margins.

The SSL provisioning module connects to the configured ISPAPI registrar module to establish a possibility to register and maintain SSL certificates at HEXONET.

## Supported Features

The ISPAPI SSL Module supports the following functions and features:

- Unified handling of different suppliers
- Support for testing environment
- Certificate products directly connected to the ISPAPI Registrar Module
- Create, renew and revoke certificates
- SSL addon
  - Load available SSL certificates and import them under a product group
  - Bulk price update by using a profit margin
  - Multicurrency support
  - Import product logos and descriptions

## Requirements

- WHMCS version 8.0 or higher
- Latest **ISPAPI Registrar Module**. This module can be downloaded [here](//github.com/hexonet/whmcs-ispapi-registrar/raw/master/whmcs-ispapi-registrar-latest.zip). Our SSL Cert Module does not support the WHMCS built-in HEXONET provider module!
- **HEXONET Live or Test Account** must be configured in the ISPAPI Registrar Module. Account creation is always free:
  - [OT&E (Test System) Account](//www.hexonet.net/signup-ote)
  - [LIVE (Real World System) Account](//www.hexonet.net/cart?signup=true)
- PHP 7.2 or higher

For the latest WHMCS minimum system requirements, please refer to [System_Requirements](//docs.whmcs.com/System_Requirements).

If you wish to use this module on older WHMCS versions, please use [Version 8.0](//github.com/hexonet/whmcs-ispapi-ssl/releases) or earlier.

## Installation / Upgrade

Download the ZIP archive including the latest release version [here](//github.com/hexonet/whmcs-ispapi-ssl/raw/master/whmcs-ispapi-ssl-latest.zip).

Copy files from the zip archive to your WHMCS installation root directory ($YOUR_WHMCS_ROOT), while keeping the folder structure intact.

e.g.

     addons/ispapissl_addon
     => $YOUR_WHMCS_ROOT/modules/addons/ispapissl_addon

     servers/ispapissl
     => $YOUR_WHMCS_ROOT/modules/servers/ispapissl

**For an update**, unzip the downloaded file and upload the content of addons and servers folders to your WHMCS root directory. Then go to `Setup > Addon Modules > ISPAPI SSL Addon > Configure` and click on the “Save Changes” button.

**NOTE**: The WHMCS root directory is the folder which contains the “configuration.php” file.

## Addon Activation

Within the WHMCS Admin area, go to `Setup > Addon Modules`

![Configuration]({{ 'assets/images/whmcs/ispapi-ssl/configuration.png' | relative_url }})

Activate the ISPAPI SSL Addon, give the module “Full Administrator” Access Control right.

## Addon Configuration

Within the WHMCS Admin area, navigate to `Addons > ISPAPI SSL`

## Import Prices

You are now ready to create SSL certificate products in WHMCS.
You can do so manually, or automatically by using our convenient addon.

### Wizard Mode

2. Fill out the form to your liking.
   - `Margin type`: Percentage or Fixed Amount.
   - `Profit margin`: percentage value or amount in your default currency.
   - `Round to Next`: select the desired rounding value.
   - `Apply rounding to all currencies`: if active, the rounding will be applied to the prices for currencies.
   - `Automatic Registration`: select the desired automatic registration behavior for the products.
   - `Generate product descriptions`: this will add provider logos and feature highlights to the imported products. The recommended Order Form Template to leverage this information is Supreme Comparison.
   - `Generate product groups`: this will create one product group per provider with group features. If disabled, all products will be assigned to the same product group. Existing products are not affected.
3. Tick the checkboxes on the products you wish to import or update.
4. Press the Import button. Existing products will be updated, missing products will be automatically created.

## How to buy a certificate

1. Go to the created certificate group on your WHMCS frontend and “Order Now” the desired certificate.
2. Follow the steps in the buying process.
3. Once the invoice is paid, you will receive an SSL certificate Configuration email, which contains a link to configure the new certificate.

   ![buy-cert01]({{ 'assets/images/whmcs/ispapi-ssl/buy_a_certificate.png' | relative_url }})

5. On this configuration page, the module will prefill the contact information and auto generate a CSR based on the domain provided and your client information. At this point, you are free to alter any information and replace the proposed CSR with your own if you wish.

   ![buycert02]({{ 'assets/images/whmcs/ispapi-ssl/buy_a_certificate_02.png' | relative_url }})

6. On the subsequent configuration page, you will be asked for a Certificate Approver Email.

   ![buycert03]({{ 'assets/images/whmcs/ispapi-ssl/buy_a_certificate_03.png' | relative_url }})

7. The configuration is now completed

   ![cert04]({{ 'assets/images/whmcs/ispapi-ssl/buy_a_certificate_04.png' | relative_url }})

8. Follow the instructions you will get via e-mail from the Certificate Authority to validate your purchase.
