## Introduction

This site provides documentation for the ISPAPI Command Line Client. Here you will find documentation for installing on several operating systems, namely Windows, macOS / OS X, and Debian derivates like Ubuntu.

What is this tool about?

This tool enables you to connect to our backend system API and to manage your account through GUI or Command Line Interface. In general, this tool consists of two major parts: Graphical User Interface (GUI) and Shell (or so-called command line interpreter).

## Requirements

Having

* git

installed and working.

## How to use this tool?

Basically this tool can be used in two ways: The GUI and Shell as shown below:

### 1 - Run it via Shell

Once you have downloaded the tool, you can run it from your Shell. First, you may start by runnig the following command there:

```bash
> ispapi --help
```

This will show you how to use the tool:

![Help Page]({{ 'assets/images/ispapicli/help.png' | relative_url }})

From this point on, you can follow the notes and run your desired command. However, here are few important notes for you:

- Note that you can either use the equal sign "=" e.g. `--command = querydomainlist`, or
- You can use spaces as a separator e.g. `--command querydomainlist`
- You may also use shortcuts, e.g. `-c` instead of `--command`, refer to the tool help command for more information about other commands

You must login first in order to requrest a command, you can login by running the command:

```bash
> ispapi -u YOUR ID -p YOUR PASSWORD -e {ote,live}
```

### 2 - Run it via GUI

There two ways to start the GUI:

- From the Shell, then run the command:

  ```bash
  > ispapi -g OR ispapi --gui
  ```

- From the executable/portable file by simply openning it, it will immediately start the GUI

:point_up: **Useful Tip: You can run exactly the same commands from the GUI and Shell!**
