## Requirements

In our system requirements, we recommend avoiding PHP versions that have reached their End of Life (EOL), as indicated in red on the [PHP Supported Versions](https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php) page.

To ensure compatibility with WHMCS, please follow these steps:

1. Check the supported PHP versions for your desired WHMCS version using our [WHMCS/PHP Matrix](https://docs.whmcs.com/PHP_Version_Support_Matrix).
2. Determine the required IonCube Loader version for your WHMCS version from the [WHMCS/IonCube Loader Matrix](https://docs.whmcs.com/IonCube_Loader_Version_Matrix).
3. Identify the compatible MySQL version for your chosen WHMCS version using the [WHMCS/MySQL Matrix](https://docs.whmcs.com/MySQL_Version_Support_Matrix).

Please note: We ensure compatibility with the latest WHMCS version and the maximum versions of the listed software dependencies. While our modules may still function with older PHP versions like PHP 7.4, we don't provide support for them and cannot guarantee their continued compatibility. If you have questions or need assistance, please reach out to us.
